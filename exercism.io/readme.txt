Leap in C#
Write a program that will take a year and report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

1	on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
2		except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
3			unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
    
For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

If your language provides a method in the standard library that does this look-up, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.
